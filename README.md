# Practicing-the-type-and-input-commands

Learned and started practicing the usage of the command type() which displays on the output the type of data that the selected variable is, and the input() command which asks the user to input a text. Example:
print("Welcome! Please enter your name to proceed!")
name = input() #Adrian for example
print("Hello, ", name) #output below:
SERVER Welcome! Please enter your name to proceed!
CLIENT Adrian #user inputs their name
SERVER Hello, Adrian
